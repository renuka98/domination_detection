#Detecting Destructive Domination in Crowdsourcing.

In this project, we use wiki edit data to detect and analyse three hypotheses related to destructive domination
1. H1: A destructive form of domination in a crowdsourcing initiative occurs when the creation and subsequent modifications of an artefact are performed by relatively few of the resources that could have performed them and at the (explicit) exclusion of resources that could have contributed constructively.

2. H2: A destructive form of domination in a crowdsourcing initiative occurs when a small number of participants contributes to a disproportionate number of tasks/artefacts and they are not best positioned to do so.

3. H3: A destructive form of domination in a crowdsourcing initiative occurs when the constructive contributions of participants is often excluded by a relatively small number of participants.
